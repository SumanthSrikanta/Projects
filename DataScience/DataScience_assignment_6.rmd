This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```


```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```


```{r}
flightsEdited<-flights %>%
mutate(date=make_date(year, month, day))
```


```{r}
flightsEdited
```


```{r}
flightsEdited %>%
  select(year, month , day, date) 
flightsEdited
```


```{r}
daily<-flightsEdited %>%
group_by(date) %>%
summarise(n=n())
(daily)
```


```{r}
ggplot(daily, aes(date, n)) + geom_line()
```


```{r}
updatedFlightsEdited<-flightsEdited %>%
  mutate(weekday=wday(date, label=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(month=month(date ,label=TRUE))
(updatedFlightsEdited)
```
Exercise 

1. Select just the data for January and compute the daily number of 
flights. Use ggplot to plot the data.

```{r}
daily<-flightsEdited %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) 
daily_jan <- daily[1:31, ]
print(daily_jan)

ggplot(daily_jan, aes(date, count)) + geom_line()
```

2. Group the data by weekday and month and visualise which days and months have the most flights going to/from NYC (the main airports to NYC are JFK and LGA).

```{r}
a <- updatedFlightsEdited %>%
  group_by(weekday, month) %>%
  summarise(flight_count=n())
b <- a[order(-a$flight_count),]
b
```


```{r}
ggplot(b, aes(x = month, y = flight_count,fill=weekday)) +
        geom_bar(stat='identity')
```
```{r}
data("mtcars")
str(mtcars)
```


```{r}
mcor <- cor(mtcars)
round(mcor, digits=2)
```


```{r}
install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(mcor)
```


```{r}
install.packages("GGally")
library("GGally")
ggcorr(mcor)
```

3. Using the cor.test() function, determine the actual correlation score between cyl and disp

```{r}
corr_value<- cor.test(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$disp,method = "pearson")
corr_value
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
