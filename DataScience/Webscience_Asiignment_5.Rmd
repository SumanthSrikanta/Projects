This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("tm") > library(tm)
```
```{r}
docs<-Corpus(DirSource("./texts", encoding="UTF-8"))
str(docs)
summary(docs)
#inspect(docs[1])
docs[[1]]
```


```{r}
docs[[1]]$meta
docs[[1]]$content
```


```{r}
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs[[1]]$content
```


```{r}
docs<-tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
docs[[1]]$content
```


```{r}
docs<-tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
docs[[1]]$content
```
```{r}
trumpDTM <- DocumentTermMatrix(docs)
trumpDTM
```


```{r}
inspect(trumpDTM) 
View(inspect(trumpDTM))
```


```{r}
inspect(trumpDTM[1:2, 1:2])

```


```{r}
trumpDTMS<-removeSparseTerms(trumpDTM, 0.05) 
trumpDTMS
inspect(trumpDTM[, c("news", "fake", "america", "great")])
```

# Explore in which documents (and with what frequencies) the terms “free”, “russia”, and “news” occur in.
```{r}
inspect(trumpDTM[, c("free","russia","news")])
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
